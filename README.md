# Assumption-Testing

## The Problem:
A library we depend on will (hopefully) be tested, but those tests may bear no relation to our actual usage of the library; and our assumptions about how the library works may not be accurate.

If we are using unit testing we will have written a bunch of expectations (using mock methods); and we can write contract tests to try and make sure our assumptions are correct, but we have no way of automatically telling if our contract tests match up with our expectations.

## The Solution:
Watch this space.
